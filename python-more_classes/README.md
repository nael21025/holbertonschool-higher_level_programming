# Python More Classes and Objects

This project contains implementations of a Rectangle class with progressive levels of complexity.

## Files

- `0-rectangle.py` - Empty Rectangle class
- `1-rectangle.py` - Rectangle with private width and height attributes
- `2-rectangle.py` - Rectangle with area and perimeter methods
- `3-rectangle.py` - Rectangle with string representation
- `4-rectangle.py` - Rectangle with repr method
- `5-rectangle.py` - Rectangle with destructor
- `6-rectangle.py` - Rectangle with class attribute for instance count
- `7-rectangle.py` - Rectangle with customizable print symbol
- `8-rectangle.py` - Rectangle with static method to compare rectangles
- `9-rectangle.py` - Rectangle with class method to create square

## Learning Objectives

- Work with class attributes and instance attributes
- Implement special methods (`__str__`, `__repr__`, `__del__`)
- Use static methods and class methods
- Understand object lifecycle and instantiation
